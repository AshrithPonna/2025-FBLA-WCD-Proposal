# 2025-FBLA-WCD-Proposal

A preview admissions application system submitted on behalf of the 2025 FBLA competition series.

A project cycle has been established, with the main emphasis being geared towards ambitious students of all ages and interests. With the current application sphere being consistent with a lot of different website domains and link connections, a new proposal has been developed that aims to keep the different components of applications on one website. This way, it can be ensured that the process of application development is _quick, simple, and preferred._ With this product, the main hope is to improve the efficiency, exponentially, of the current system in place that oversees the entry, release, and turnout of various applications.

As regionalists, with associated contributions by **Eugene Kim, Ansh Gupta, and Ashrith Ponna**, a base infrastructure on website development has been produced.<br>
The main applications of this website are vast, with numerous capabilities and potential, especially with **programming support from CSS, Javascript, and HTML.**<br>
The follow components are all features of this website project (_do keep it mind that relevant (future) changes will most likely not be in oversight at the current moment)_:<br>
* Animated UI that allows interactions from user.
* Interactive (and animated) prompts that connect seamlessly to other domains and website infrastructures.
* Active user portals that manages and stores account credentials.
* Updating application information with capabilities to display and view such sources of information.
* Different site transitions from one page to another.
* Countdown timer that alerts applicants about release dates and events.

For the future, depending on development status, a more broader audience may be reached, with the movement out of the application sector and into a more public sector.

It is with great hope that this development helps to improve the overall efficacy of applications in the current world today. Thank you!
